# Base Architecture

This repository is an attempt to experiment with several core concepts and make them
work together and provide a solid architecture for building web apps easily.

## Core concepts

1. Modular
2. Caching
3. External secrets
4. Observability
5. Exception free failures

NOTE: WIP

## Modular

- Composable

Should handle
- validation between client + api
- validation for service
- gateways

## Caching

- Transparent caching while retaining fine grain cache busting

## External secrets

## Observability

- Should support journey 

## Exception free failures

- Monad based
